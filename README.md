# Module One Final Project SUPERHEROS

My first project at Flatiron! I built this project using the Command Line Interface using OOP design. I used CRUD methods to interact with the user.


### User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to enter my name to retrieve my records
* As a user, I want to be able to create one or more Superheros
* As a user, I should be able to assign Superheros superpowers and organizations
* As a user, I want to be able to edit or delete my choices

### How to play--

1. Clone repo to your local computer
2. CD into file and hit code . or open up text editor of your choice and open the cloned folder.
3. In terminal type the following commands-
4. bundle install   -installs all gems to your local computer
5. rake db:migrate  -connects to the database and creates the appropriate tables
6. rake db:seed     -provies the program with prewritten data
7. rake db:start    -will run the program
8. Follow the prompts and enjoy a simple game on the CLI!
